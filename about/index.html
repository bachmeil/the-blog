<h2>About</h2>
<p>I'm a professor of economics. Sometimes I mess around with blogging setups. Sometimes I use them to blog. 
You can visit <a href="https://lancebachmeier.com">my professional site</a> if that's what you're after.</p>
<p>Some things that interest me: High-functionality, low-polish tools I can use to automate work. Programming. The 
challenge of finding the lowest-effort way to do something. Learning about a lot of things. 
Computational economics and econometrics.
