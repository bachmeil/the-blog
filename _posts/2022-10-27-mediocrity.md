title: In praise of mediocrity
---
Sometimes I think of mediocre people as low achievers. Some of them certainly are.

On the other hand, you might have someone that goes to work every day for 30 years, with no days that are noteworthy, and yet the cumulative effect of the contributions they've made is in the far right end of the distribution. 

Maybe the mediocre guy wrote a quick program to do some task. Only a few people used it, if anyone else used it at all.

Over the next five years he fixed all the bugs and cleaned up the interface and added small but vital functionality. Then the five years after that he documented his app. 

After ten years, there's a nice little app used by thousands of people. Each day he programmed and wrote documentation, his work was mediocre. You would have been bored to tears watching him work.

What wasn't mediocre was his consistent work on the app and the documentation. The end result was a stunning body of work that helps thousands of people. Consistently mediocre is very different from mediocre.
