title: Blogging will return
---
I've seen the disappearance of blogs I liked to read. I don't think this is a sign that blogging is going to die out. Numerous Hacker News comments say things like social media makes it so much easier to reach a big audience, so blogs are no longer relevant, but I think this is just wrong. Here's a list, in no particular order, of observations on this topic.

- Monetizing a blog is probably a ton harder today than 10 or 15 years ago. Part of that has been the disappearance of blogs from Google search results. As a result, we've seen some blogs shut down and others move to Substack or Medium.
- There will always be some blogs shutting down no matter what. After a few years, people may get tired of blogging and want to spend their time on something else.
- Some people don't care if their writing blog posts or making short comments on social media. They want an audience, so they're more than happy to shift to writing for social media rather than a blog, which is so much more work.
- Blogging has value both to the writer and the reader. Both of them think more deeply with a blog post than with a hot take. Long, careful writing offers different benefits, and there will always be a market for the value it creates.
- There's no obvious reason it has to be hard to find blog posts on particular topics. Someone will eventually solve the problem of discoverability, and they'll make money as a result.
- Blogging really shines when you write about something that will be relevant a few months or longer into the future. Nobody looks up social media posts after a day. Blogs hold information that is easily discoverable years later.

I think blogging will have a bright future once it's possible to find blog posts the way we used to. Now to get myself in trouble: I predict that will happen by the end of 2025.
