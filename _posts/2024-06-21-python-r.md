title: Getting Python and RStudio to work together
---
I ran into a strange problem today while attempting to use RStudio as my Python IDE. I don't do all that much with Python, but since I work with data as part of my job, it's inevitable that I'll have to do *some* things with it (and I'm perfectly fine with that).

It's always "just worked" before. Today I got a strange message when I tried to run a Python script:

```
Would you like to create a default python environment for the reticulate package? (Yes/no/cancel)
```

It was annoying because

- It showed up every time I tried to do anything.
- It would only take "no" as an answer.

It was a hopeless loop, because "no" was the only way to break out of it, but the message returned as soon as I tried to do anything with Python again. Some experimentation revealed that the solution is:

```
library(reticulate)
use_python("/usr/bin/python3")
```

The location in the last line is the location of the Python executable installed on my machine; it may be elsewhere on yours.
