title: Surveying Retirement Advice
---
Every two or three years, I go crazy with retirement planning for a few weeks. I'm back at it again. 

The big change from my last deep dive - at least for me - is the explosion of retirement content on YouTube. There's a lot of good advice on there (and, obviously, some bad advice too).

**Suze Orman's toxic, uninformed commentary.** In the earliest days of thinking about retirement in detail, which was around the time I got my first professional job, a majority of my advice came from Suze Orman. Why? Mostly because she was on TV all the time and we didn't have a lot of alternatives. YouTube didn't even exist back then. After listening to her, I'd feel a sense of hopelessness when thinking about retirement. Based on her advice, I'd literally have had to save my entire paycheck just to pull out a meager retirement at 75. Her rules of thumb on the required amount of savings and net worth to buy anything other than the necessities were terrifying. Since I didn't have any money, and there was no hope I'd do a lot of saving beyond my work IRA, I blocked retirement out of my mind for years.

This came to an end once I realized that Suze Orman was completely and utterly full of crap. I pulled out a spreadsheet and did some calculations of my own and it was clear that there was no logical basis for the claims she made about savings. Even more important, I started to see people retire - including my parents - and they had financial situations nothing like Suze Orman's rules, yet they were doing just fine. Looking at my own expenses, my projected Social Security payments, the rate I was accumulating savings, and historical stock returns, retirement at 65 while maintaining my existing lifestyle would actually be easy. That was using a 3% rule I'd constructed before hearing of the 4% rule.

**Retirement YouTube.** What I like about retirement YouTube is the many channels by people that have actually retired. Others are run by financial planners that talk about actual cases and educating us about their profession. People can and do retire with less than a million dollars saved. These videos pass the sniff test, because they're consistent with the numbers I've seen for actual retirees like my parents.

**Non-financial retirement advice.** I want to close with a couple pieces of non-financial retirement advice I got. I don't remember where they came from, and I modified the advice. One of my biggest concerns was "what would I do if I retire?" I was concerned that I'd be bored if I retired, so I thought 70 was the earliest I'd possibly consider retiring. These two pieces of advice set me straight. I'll continue doing what I'm doing right now, but I'll be doing more of what I want to do and less of what I don't.

Prompt 1: If you cut back to 50% of your working hours, how would it change how you spend your time? You get half of your working hours to spend doing anything you want. 

It was enjoyable thinking about such a scenario once I thought about the large blocks of time I'd have to work on the things that are important to me. I'd be able to work on the goals that motivated me to get into this profession in the first place. The main problem was that my list of things to do was *way too long* for the available hours. In fact, I had more stuff on this list than I have on my current list.

Prompt 2: What would you be doing this week if you were retired? 

This was a better exercise because I used my real-world task list for the current week. I crossed off anything I didn't want to do, conditional on not needing to do it. Without adding anything like travel or golf to the list, only crossing things off my current list, it was clear I'd be overscheduled even as a fully retired person. 

Prompt 2a: I later came up with my own variant to make this even clearer. I use a weekly note to record the things I'm working on. When I put things in the note, I categorize them as things I'd do in retirement or not do. Making this kind of list clarifies what a typical week will actually look like. There's just SO MUCH STUFF on there that boredom is not a relevant concern.

I still have a long time until retirement. These exercises are purely academic at this stage. Nonetheless, I shortened my expected retirement age to 65 after doing them.
