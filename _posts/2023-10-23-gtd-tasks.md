title: This is what you need to manage tasks for GTD

Quick post today on what you need to manage tasks for GTD.

I hate the trend toward complicated task management tools. All you need is a few features. You can even do your task management on paper (though electronic tools work better).

- Low-friction capture of *all* tasks
- Ability to mark a task as a next action or not.
- Ability to mark a task as active, inactive, or closed.
- Ability to specify that a particular task is part of a project.

If done on paper, you'd enter tasks for a particular project on their own page, and then you'd probably want to keep a separate running list of all next actions, which would involve some duplication.

If this sounds too simple, it means you've added busy work to your project management. Or maybe you're using organizing as a form of procrastination. Either way, anything beyond what I've listed here is unnecessary.
