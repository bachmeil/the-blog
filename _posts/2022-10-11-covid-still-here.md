title: Covid, it's still here
---
Repeat after me: Covid is not the flu. For some of us, at least, it's hard to get rid of Covid.

I am now in my fifth week of attempting to recover. Week 1 was terrible. Week 2 was better. I thought I was in the clear in week 3. Week 4 I had serious symptoms again, and I was able to do almost no work. I have new medicine so week 5 seems to be better.

Some of us have trouble recovering from Covid. I'm sure I eventually will. This is a massive hit to my productivity. If this stays with us forever, we should expect a permanent hit to GDP, since we're just not as productive as we'd be without Covid.

I hope week 5 will be the end of it for me.
