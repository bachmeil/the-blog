title: Handling Many Projects
---
In [my post yesterday](https://bachmeil.github.io/the-blog/2022/09/07/scaling.html) I went into some of the issues associated with the scale of information I have to manage. One dimension of this is that I have so many projects. I won't pretend to have figured out how to manage them as well as I'd like.

- It needs to be easy to create a new project. That includes putting it in a place that I'll review it regularly.
- It needs to be easy to get stuff into the projects. An email with reference files? It needs to be added to the project. A new task? It needs to go into the project, and it needs a deadline and a reminder, along with subtasks for completion and any notes I want to take.
- Notes and ideas need to be easily added/edited. Same for milestones to monitor progress.
- It needs to be easy to review projects to make sure they're moving along.
- I need to review all of my projects to decide which are the priority at a point in time and which can wait.

I've tried many tools. Heck, I've been to the breaking point, where I was overwhelmed by the number of projects I had going. Projects need:

- Description
- Task management
- Notes
- Milestones to monitor progress
- Files, links, and other reference material

All available software falls short. Task managers like Todoist are worse than useless for this kind of thing. A lengthy todo list with no way to know what to work on is a recipe for stress that makes me shut down. Notes tools like Evernote are likewise useless because they don't have a good way to query across projects. All the tools and systems have their limitations, usually around being designed for a small number of small projects, meaning they do not scale to the volume I operate at. This is no doubt a hard problem. Everyone has their own needs.
