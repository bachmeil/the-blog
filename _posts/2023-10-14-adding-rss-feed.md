I finally got around to adding an RSS feed to this blog. I implemented it following the instructions [in this post](https://dzhavat.github.io/2020/01/19/adding-an-rss-feed-to-github-pages.html). You can see the implementation [in the Github repo for the blog](https://github.dev/bachmeil/the-blog). In `_config.yml`, I added a title and the `jekyll-feed` plugin. In `header.html`, I added a link to the feed. So yeah, it doesn't take much effort, does it.
