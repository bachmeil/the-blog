I was surprised while reading Brad DeLong's [Slouching Towards Utopia](https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/j-bradford-delong/slouching-towards-utopia/9781541604247/) that he relies heavily on the fiscal theory of the price level. I'll admit that I am not an expert on it. I've known about it for 25 years or so, as one of my grad school professors did some work related to it, but I never bothered to dig into it in any depth. The initial literature, while readable for a PhD student, had a writing style that made it really hard to see the points the authors were trying to make. Luckily, there are better introductions today. Some examples:

- [Analyzing Fiscal Policy Matters More Than Ever: The Fiscal Theory of the Price Level and Inflation](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2022/eb_22-39)
- [Fiscal Theory of the Price Level](https://users.nber.org/~bassetto/research/palgrave/ftheorypost.pdf)
- [An old reference that some people liked](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w7668/w7668.pdf) (but never helped me)
- [The Fiscal Theory of the Price Level: An Introduction and Overview (article)](https://www.johnhcochrane.com/research-all/fiscal-theory-jep-article)
- [A conference on the FTPL in 2016](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/event/next-steps-for-the-fiscal-theory-of-the-price-level/) Maybe not useful for understanding the details, but clearly presents the issues
- [A Handbook chapter that may or may not be helpful, that I haven't read](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/files/eric-leeper/files/leeper-leith-handbook-feb2016-final.pdf)
