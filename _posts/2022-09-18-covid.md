After 2.5 years, I finally tested positive for Covid. I have a few thoughts:

- Using the term "mild" to describe my symptoms is bad. It makes it sound like I had to blow my nose a couple of times. My symptoms may have been mild *relative to the worst case* but they were still pretty bad. I lost basically an entire week of work. I didn't have breathing troubles, but if this had been a cold, it would have been a severe cold. Does it matter? I think it does. We should avoid Covid even if we expect to have mild symptoms. It's costly to you, your family, your employer, your coworkers, and society in general.
- It's good tests are plentiful. I might have spread it to dozens of other people if I hadn't tested as soon as I had symptoms. 
- The preferred spelling is apparently all caps: COVID. That's dumb. Nobody wants to type in all caps.
- It's not entirely clear when to quarantine and when not. The guidance isn't that bad, really. What I wanted was a website that asked a few questions and then popped up a window telling me how long to quarantine and wear a mask. The situation could be a lot worse. It's better than a blanket rule that requires most to overquarantine. There's room for improvement.
