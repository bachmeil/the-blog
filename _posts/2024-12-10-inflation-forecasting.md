title: Forecasting Long-Term Inflation
---
My early research was dominated by the topic of inflation. I'm not going to go into the details of that today. Instead, I want to respond to some things I see in various places on the internet (Reddit, HN, YouTube, ...).

It's trendy to talk about "In today's economy". The economy is actually pretty good relative to past decades. It might be trendy to claim the economy is horrible, but trendy and accurate are too different things, perhaps even mutually exclusive.

> the cost of living has risen markedly in recent years as inflation has soared

That's a quote from the *Chronicle of Higher Education* in November 2024. It paints a picture of living costs that are out-of-control and rising rapidly. October's CPI inflation rate was 2.6%. Inflation hasn't soared. Maybe what was meant is that the cost of living has soared. It exceeded the Fed's target in March 2021 and rose until June 2022. So, it "soared" for a 15-month period that ended more than two years before the article was written.

More likely what the author (who is probably not a PhD economist) means is that the cost of living rose as things opened up after the pandemic and didn't return to their previous levels. Of course, that's nonsense, because we always expect there to be some inflation. The average inflation rate over the last 30 years has been 2.5%. On the eve of the pandemic, the inflation rate was 2.5%, and I don't recall a lot of screaming about out-of-control inflation at that time. Inflation was at 2.9% in 2018, and I don't remember a lot of "in this economy" comments then, either.

Let's do an exercise. Let's look at where the CPI is today, and where it would be with a constant 2.5% annual inflation rate from October 2019 to today (just before the pandemic, to make the math simple). The current CPI value reported on FRED is 315.454. October 2019 it was 257.155. At 2.5% inflation, the CPI would be 290.9 rather than 315.5. That's an 8.4% increase in the cost of living. That's something, for sure, but it's not a crisis, and it doesn't account for the fact that at least part of that 8.4% increase was a direct response to higher wages. 

Income is harder to measure (how do you account for someone that retired due to the pandemic) but average hourly earnings of all employees rose from 28.23 in October 2019 to 35.48 in October 2024. That's an increase of 26%. We don't have a natural benchmark for hourly wage growth, but we can compare with the good old days of the five years earlier. October 2014-October 2019 wage growth was 15%. So at least in terms of per-hour wages, the cost of living rose 8.4 percentage points more than target, but wages grew 11 percentage points more than in the five pre-pandemic years.

The hourly wage absolutely excludes retirees, business owners, children, and others. We can then zoom out to a higher level. Is real GDP still growing? The answer is yes. It's up 12.2% in the last five years. There's more output, there's more income, so if there's a problem, it's one of distribution. That's outside the scope of this post.

> Well if inflation is so low, what about [one category of expenditure] or [one location] or [personal experience]

This useless argument got a lot of attention when CNN ran a story about a family that consumed an extremely unrepresentative amount of milk each month, and then attempted to mislead viewers into thinking this was a normal situation. You see a similar argument all over the internet. The whole point of constructing a measure of the cost of living is that you don't want to focus on one tiny part of your overall consumption when calculating how much it costs to live. 

Do you see retirement planners telling people that they can retire based on projections of the price of milk over the next 30 years? Of course not. Anyone doing that would cease to be a retirement planner for long. The question is so absurd that you're dismissive of the premise. Yet that is what CNN was proposing we do.

Also notoriously absent from their reporting, and another reason you don't want to focus on just one item, is that the price of milk started rising in the middle of 2018. It went from $2.84 in July 2018 to $3.25 by January 2020, a 14% increase in only 18 months. I searched but did not find any evidence that CNN did stories on the soaring price of milk before the pandemic.

The non-misleading version of the story is that milk prices peaked in 2014 at $3.86 a gallon. The price collapsed to $2.84 by July 2018, and then recovered to $4.20 in May 2022. In real terms, the 2022 milk price was substantially lower than the 2014 price. Prices go up and down. You can't take a highly volatile price and only run news stories on a selected sample of the times they go up. This is all stuff that a basic fact-checker would have raised if the goal was accuracy in reporting.

> Price increases are permanent

This logic is quite common. Since prices never go down, any inflation today means prices will be that much higher forever. This logic feels natural, but is built on strong, unstated assumptions that are hard to justify.

First, over any long period of time, the US CPI has an upward trend. That does not imply that if inflation is two percentage points above target this year, you should increase your forecast of the cost of living two percentage points next year, and the year after, and so on for the rest of your life. It could be the case, but it's nothing more than an arbitrary, unjustified assumption.

Second, the CPI does in fact decrease every so often. There was a bout of inflation prior to the financial crisis that was followed by a noticeable deflation in 2009. Inflation floated around zero, and was even negative, for most of 2015. On a month-to-month basis, prices fell in the first three months of the pandemic, though never enough for the year-over-year value to go below zero.

If the Federal Reserve keeps its promise, future inflation rates will be low enough to offset the high inflation rates of 2022. Look no further than 2013-2016 if you're skeptical that the Fed is going to run inflation at a low level for an extended period of time. They loosened things up in 2017, but the 2013-2016 had a total of five months with an inflation rate of 2%, a maximum of 2.2%, and fluctuations around 1%.

So, in light of the above, we might ask what would be needed for 2020-2029 to have an inflation rate of 2.5% per year (in other words, what is needed so that someone retiring in 2019 and planning for 2.5% inflation over the next decade would have been correct)? The inflation rate would have to be 1% per year for the next five years. I'm not sure they'll get there, but we've seen those inflation rates before. 2% inflation until the end of 2029 would give a decade inflation rate of 3%.

The choice of a decade is arbitrary. Surely nobody is going to fail in their retirement plan because inflation was 3% instead of 2.5% over a decade. 1.8% inflation over the next decade will put the 15-year inflation rate at 2.5%. 2% inflation over the next ten years will give a 2.7% 15-year inflation rate.

While it's hard to predict what will happen, the argument that the 2022 inflation is permanent is nothing more than an assumption. The Federal Reserve can, and in my opinion will, keep inflation below 2.5% for an extended period of time to bring the cost of living back to trend. Having said that, I'm making an assumption that the Federal Reserve is unchanged as an institution. If there are major changes to the conduct of monetary policy, we may well see higher inflation rates, but that too is outside the scope of this discussion.
